# Studying Remotely at US College while living in Korea

I am senior accounting student of the Ohio State University. I am currently living in Korea due to COVID-19 concern and studying remotely from here.

## Pros and cons of studying remotely

There are some advantage and disadvantage relate to study remotely in college

## Pros
### Number 1 : You can set your own class and study schedule
Many of the online classes are administered in asynchronous format - meaning that you can take class and study whenever it works for you as long as you complete everything before due date!

### Number 2 : No need to commute
You don't have to worry about taking a bus every day and wasting around 30 miniutes simply to get to the classroom from home

## Cons
### Number 1 : Procrastinating
Because there is no one watching you, it is much easier to procrastinate and not take class until it is almost too late

### Number 2 : Time zone difference
Like me, if you are taking classes far away from the school, there can be significant time difference which force you to attend lecture in the middle of the night

## Additional Information About Me
Although I am accounting student and I am not majoring in computer-related subject, I am currently studying computer science by myself and focusing on learning JAVA and Python. Also I am taking some lessons about Swift to do some side projects related to iOS

## Works I have completed
1. Developing codes that can possibly automate tasks related to my previous job (sorting and manipulating pdf files through Python)
2. Swift project to develop a hangman style game
